Hello!

Welcome to my first front-end project developped on the Origamid Webdesign course.

To develop this website it was learnt the concepts of programming as well as a good taste, and references of a clean design for a bike sales website.

What I have used to build:

 - HTML;
 - JavaScript;
 - CSS.
